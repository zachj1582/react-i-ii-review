# Project Summary
In this project, we will work in small groups to review several React concepts. Your instructor will divide the class into groups of 3-5 students. Each group will work together on a different `.md` file for 20 minutes. The goal is for every group to complete the Remember, Understand and Apply sections. The Analyze, Evaluate and Create sections are for extra practice if you have extra time. After 20 minutes, each group will move to the next `.md` file to review different concepts. After every group has completed all of the `.md` files, you will review them as a class.
