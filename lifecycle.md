### Remember

Use https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#the-component-lifecycle and http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/ to answer these on your own then compare answers as a group

1.  Each component has several "lifecycle methods" that you can override to...?

2.  What are the 4 categories of lifecycle methods? (these are the headings from the first link)

3.  What are the names of the 6 commonly used lifecycle methods? (these are in bold in the first link)

### Understand

Discuss this question in pairs if you have a 4-person group

4.  What's going on in this code?

```jsx
import React, { Component } from "react";

class Mentor extends Component {
  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log("Logan saved the day!");
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Logan Mace</h1>
        <h2>{this.props.questions.length}</h2>
        <h3>questions to answer</h3>
        <button onClick={this.props.answerQuestion}>Answer a question!</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Apply

Try these on your own, but work together if you start to get stuck.

5.  Update the Mentor component above so that the message that is currently being console.log'd is displayed below the number of questions answered instead.
